AHB to APB Bridge Design using Verilog HDL 

∗ Implemented Architectural Design of Bridge Consisting of AHB master interface, AHB slave interface, APB interface,
and APB controller.
∗ AHB2APB bridge Facilitated a seamless interface between high speed AHB and low power APB ensuring optimal
AHB to APB transactions.
∗ APB controller effectively operated as well-structured finite state machine (FSM) of 8 states controlling the
transfers from AHB to APB.
∗ Write a verification test bench using System Verilog for All Functionality test.
∗ Tools/Language Used: EDA Playground, Verilog, Syatem Verilog
